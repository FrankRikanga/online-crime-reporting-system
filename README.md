Online Crime Reporting System

A secure and efficient web-based Crime Reporting Portal System developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This system enables citizens to report crimes online while allowing police administrators to manage, assign, and track cases in a structured and transparent digital environment.

 Project Overview

The Online Crime Reporting System is designed to modernize the traditional crime reporting process by providing a centralized digital platform.

Instead of physically visiting police stations to file complaints, users can submit crime reports online from anywhere. The system ensures proper case recording, automatic assignment, and real-time tracking of case progress.

This project demonstrates full-stack web development skills including backend logic, database management, authentication systems, and responsive user interface design.
